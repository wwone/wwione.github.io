# Bob Swanson's Repositories

## AUTHOR is a system that allows creation of e-documents from simple text. 
The document can be as simple or as complex as desired, but the system was
devised to easily handle document with large numbers of images. 

### Output formats of AUTHOR include:

- Kindle
- EPUB
- HTML (which can be packaged into a website-in-a-box, and also can be single HTML page or a set of multiple pages)
- PDF (fully interactive)
- PDF (formatted for print output, such as print-on-demand)
- REVEAL (special option to make these very useful web-based presentations)
